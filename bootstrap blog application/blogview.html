        <p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
            automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability
            to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.
            These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer
            including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used
            for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system.
            This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular
            a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

        <p>Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes
            simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial
            robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile
            devices such as smartphones.</p>
        <p>Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like
            the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices
            were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated
            electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital
            electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The speed, power, and versatility of
            computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then.</p>
